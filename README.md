# Computer Graphics - JOHN LEMON'S HAUNTED JAUNT


### DESCRIPTION :
**"John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt"** is a **fun** and **spooky** **beginner-friendly 3D stealth game**, crafted as part of **Unity’s official tutorials**.

Take on the role of the fearless (and slightly zesty) **John Lemon**, trapped inside a **haunted mansion** where restless ghosts roam the halls. 
***Your goal ?*** Outsmart the spirits, stay out of sight, collect **hidden keys**, and make **a daring escape** before time runs out.

Can you keep your cool and guide **John** to safety **-** or will the **ghosts** get the last laugh ?



## TECHNOLOGIES USED
The **main technologies** used for this project / game are :

**UNITY** - The **game engine** used to develop the game.

**C#** - The **programming** language used for scripting and game logic.

## GAME FEATURES
Throughout the tutorial, we've developed quite a few **game features**, such as :
- The **movement mechanics** of our **main character**, allowing smooth and responsive navigation throughout the environment.

- The creation of **movement patterns for the ghosts**, which patrol the map in **specific paths**, adding **challenge** and **tension** to the gameplay.

- The implementation of a **detection system** where the main character can be spotted by the **Gargoyle lights**, increasing the difficulty and the need for careful planning.


In addition to the features mentioned earlier, which were implemented based on the tutorial, I personally added **new functionalities** to leave **my mark** on this project. These include :
- A comprehensive **main menu**, offering players the option to **start a new game**, **view high scores**, access **game instructions**, or **quit the game**.
  
- A **pause menu**, allowing players to **take a break**, review settings, or **resume gameplay** at any time.
  
- **Collectibles**, where players must gather all the **hidden keys** scattered throughout the **haunted house** in order to **escape**, adding an **extra layer of challenge and exploration**.
  
- An **alternative point of view**, offering both **first-person** and **third-person** camera options, so players can experience the game from different perspectives.
  
- **High score tracking**, with the ability to **save** and **view players’ preferences**, allowing them to **compare their performance** and revisit their best moments.



## TESTING METHODS
To try out the final version of the game, download the **archive** named **'BUILD1'** from the **'GAMEBUILD'** directory. Once extracted into a folder of your choice, simply launch the **file** ending in ***'.exe'*** to start playing.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure the **game runs smoothly from the start**, it's recommended that **all extracted files** be placed together in a **single folder**. If this is not done according to the instructions, **the game will fail to launch**, and an **error message** will appear on the screen.

- **Minimum requirements** : **250 - 300 MB** of free space for the download.
  
If you'd like to explore the process behind the creation of this game, you can download the **archives** *( ASSETS, PACKAGES, PROJECTSETTINGS )* from the **'PROGRAM FILES'** directory. Once downloaded, feel free to modify the existing game or gain insight into the project's development process.
> [!NOTE]
> Even though some folders contain **multiple archives**, they have been split this way to upload the complete project to **GitHub** ( *with a file size limit of 25 MB* ). For example, the *'ASSETS'* folder contains 7 archives. If you download the files according to my folder structure, meaning all the files from *'ASSETS'* should be placed in the parent ***'ASSETS' directory***, the game / project will **run properly**.



## ABOUT THE GAME FILES
The files developed throughout the tutorial have **clear names**, making it easy for anyone to understand the purpose of each file. Any additional modifications made to the game, as well as the creation of new files to introduce new functionalities, are clearly marked within the project. 

This is done both to **help newcomers** understand the changes and to make it easier to pick up the project again after a long period.
